 * Node for Nested Loop Joins.
 * Basic idea is to build a batch pool of rows of the right child node [child(1)],
 * and then iterate over it for each of the left child rows [child(0)], evaluating if the conjuncts
 * (such as the join conditions) are satisfied. If it does satisfy the conjuncts,
 * write the output row into output batch, which will be pulled by the parent nodes
 * up above in the Query Plan hierarchy.
 *
 * The idea of extending this class from the BlockingJoinNode is to block this node
 * while it is waiting to build the row batches of the right child.
 *
 * Since this operator follows an iterator based model, you will some familiar functions such as
 * Open(), Prepare(), GetNext() and Close(). The first of these methods, i.e. Open(), is
 * already implemented for you in the BlockingJoinNode. It is responsible for initializing the
 * building of the right child row batches in a separate thread, so that you do not have to worry
 * about them explicitly.
